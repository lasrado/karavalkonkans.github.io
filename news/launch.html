								<h2>Karaval Konkans Australia Inc. launched in Australia</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Konkani, a unique language with a rich history of over 2000 years spoken in a small coastal region of India has today spread its fragrance around the globe thanks to our illustrious and enterprising community members that are living across the world. From the initial pioneers who went from Mangalore to Australia, the Konkani speaking community today has grown in multitudes.  As we assimilate in the local culture, it is equally important to focus our attention on a unique bond that we all share – Konkani.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Karaval Konkans Australia Inc.</b> is a newly incorporated association that has taken a bold step to invigorate and preserve the uniqueness of Konkani traditions, culture and language in the ever-growing Konkani speaking community as a gift to the coming generations.  A dream dreamt by one, a thought shared by many, with a vision to become a movement across Australia united through our language and heritage would be a great way to summarise.  It takes a great team to make this a dream a reality and bring it to fruition.
                            </p>
                            <p>  The office bearers for the inaugural committee of Karaval Konkans Australia are as follows
                                <br>
                                <b>Founder Chairman: Wilson Kalakar</b> - The dreamer who envisioned connecting Konkani communities in Australia having successfully initiating the first Konkani Association while in Israel. Having been an active dramatist and theatre personality while in India, it was his initiative that enabled every major city in Australia to screen Osmitay last year.
                                <br>
                                <b>President: Jane Dsouza</b> - Raised in a Konkani-speaking family, Jane’s strong cultural ties drive her passion for preserving and promoting Konkani heritage. A dynamic leader, who has successfully led other associations earlier, she excels at bringing people together and inspiring action. We are confident that under her leadership, our association will flourish and continue fostering Konkani culture for future generations.
                                <br>
                                <b>Vice President: Roshan Valder</b> - His long association with the Konkani community in Australia combined with his undying love for Konkani culture and heritage makes Roshan a strong pillar of this association. A strong desire to give back to the community, and his commitment to safeguard the uniqueness of Konkani culture in multicultural Australia for the generations make him a perfect fit for this role.
                                <br>
                                <b>Secretary: Caroline Dsouza</b> - An enterprising and meticulous individual with untapped potential whose strong Konkani roots have drawn her to working for this association. With her organisational skills, she will keep everyone focussed on achieving every initiative that the association undertakes.
                                <br>
                                <b>Treasurer: Ashley D Silva</b> - An ardent lover of Konkani language, culture and traditions, Ashley has been actively involved in music, drama and arts for many years in addition to leading volunteer organisations prior to coming to Australia. 
                                <br>
                                <b>Sports Secretary: Manoj Dsilva</b> - He believes that Konkani culture is a treasure trove of rich traditions, wisdom and deeply embedded knowledge. Manoj derives inspiration from our rich heritage and works towards keeping our culture alive and thriving by being a part of Konkan Karavals Australia so that we can take pride in our identity and tradition.
                                <br>
                                <b>Media Secretary: Darel Lasrado</b> - Enthusiastic by nature, with a deep love for Konkani, passionate about keeping the connection to his roots Darel has volunteered his experience and time to be on the committee to forge the path for the next generations of Konkani lovers.  
                                <br>
                                <b>Grants Coordinator: Wilson Dsouza</b> - A finance professional with extensive volunteer experience in both India and Australia, he brings valuable insights and a strong commitment to the committee, enhancing its initiatives and objectives with a diverse perspective and practical knowledge from his background.
                                <br>
                                <b>Events & Marketing Coordinator: Joe Sequeira</b> - Being a passionate supporter of the Konkani culture and its language, Joe’s utmost aim is to incorporate this into the many events we hold in Karaval Konkans. The Konkani community in Australia has many talented individuals and we need to showcase these talents through this platform throughout Australia. This not only will bring our community together but also encourage the younger generations to carry this culture and our traditions forward.
                                <br>
                                <b>Music and Performing Arts Coordinator: Sandria Rodrigues</b> - Born and raised along the Konkan coastline, Sandy believes in living and integrating Konkani culture in our homes far away from Mangalore. Sandy wishes to share her learnings with others and is excited to be a part of Karaval Konkans Australia, contributing in every way possible to keep the Konkan flag flying high.
                                <br>
                                <b>Youth Engagement Representative: Ria Valder</b> - Growing in Australia and always being apart of the Konkan community, Ria has a strong sense of duty to promote and preserve heritage and Konkani language. She will engage with young members of our community, foster a sense of pride and belonging in our younger generation and ensure that our traditions and language continue to thrive in this multicultural country
                                <br>
                                <b>Young Talents Coordinator: Bonita D Silva</b> - Bonita has a fantastic talent for nurturing children's skills. She’ll be the right person to mould our kids to thrive in our wonderful culture. Having been involved in several groups before and acting as a catalyst for the Soulstirrers Kuwait Kids Band, which made a splash in Konkani music, Bonnie will definitely be the go-to person for our young ones.
                                <br>
                                <b>Spiritual Director: Rev. Fr Jacob Alvares</b> - Currently the Assistant Parish Priest at St. Christopher’s Parish, Syndal, Fr. Jacob has kindly consented to be the Spiritual Director. With his vast experience across generations of Konkani Speaking community members, we are sure Fr. Jacob will be a guiding force to keep our faith and heritage as the foundation of his association.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The association is committed to make a difference through various activities including music, theatre, art and community events that showcase the richness of Konkani to the world. A unique aspect of this association is that there are no joining fees, rather one that will rely on the support and participation of the community across all its initiatives.  The committee requests all community members to connect through its social media channels for the latest news and events.
